Starting from May 2024, I will join the [Institute of Global Change Biology](https://seas.umich.edu/globalchangebiology) at the University of Michigan as a Postdoctoral Fellow, under the supervision of Drs. [Brian Weeks](http://bcweeks.weebly.com/) and [Kai Zhu](https://zhulab.seas.umich.edu/). My current research focuses on how spatial and temporalchanges of species presence shape their interactions and community structure across multiple scales. My work uses a combination of theoretical modeling, data analysis, and lab experiments. Read more about my past and current projects [here](/research/).

I obtained my PhD from the [Program of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://biosciences.rice.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology-graduate-program) at the Department of BioSciences, Rice University. I joined Dr. Volker Rudolf's [lab](http://volkerrudolf.weebly.com) in Fall 2019.

Before coming to Rice, I graduated from the University of Chicago, where I worked with Drs. [Cathy Pfister](https://pfisterlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Alison Anastasio](https://environmentalstudies.uchicago.edu/people/alison-anastasio) on characterizing plant communities on urban contaminated soil.

Before coming to the US for college, I spent my first 18 years in Beijing, China.

Besides my research interests, I am into street photography, visual art, anime, and Japanese literature. While I am not a typical outdoor person, I enjoy birding, skateboarding and occasional hiking.
