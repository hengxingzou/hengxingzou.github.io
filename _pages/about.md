Welcome to my page! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute of Global Change Biology](https://seas.umich.edu/globalchangebiology), University of Michigan working with [Brian Weeks](http://bcweeks.weebly.com/) and [Kai Zhu](https://zhulab.seas.umich.edu/). My current research focuses on how spatial and temporal changes of species presence shape their interactions and community structure across multiple scales. My work uses a combination of theoretical modeling, data analysis, and lab experiments. Read more about my past and current projects [here](/research/).

I obtained my PhD with [Volker Rudolf](http://volkerrudolf.weebly.com) at [Rice University](https://biosciences.rice.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology-graduate-program) in Houston, TX. Before moving to Rice, I graduated from the University of Chicago, where I worked with [Cathy Pfister](https://pfisterlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Alison Anastasio](https://www.alisonanastasio.com/) on characterizing plant communities on urban contaminated soil.

Before coming to the United States for college, I spent my first 18 years in Beijing, China.

Besides my research interests, I enjoy street photography, visual art, anime, and Japanese literature (yes I read Japanese). While I am not a typical outdoor person, I enjoy birding and occasional hiking.
